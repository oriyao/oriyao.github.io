∀for all

p⇒q p implies q / if p, then q

p⇔q p if and only if q /p is equivalent to q / p and q are equivalent

##2.Sets

x∈A x belongs to A / x is an element (or a member) of A

x∉A x does not belong to A / x is not an element (or a member) of A

A⊂B A is contained in B / A is a subset of B

A⊃B A contains B / B is a subset of A

A∩B A cap B / A meet B / A intersection B

A∪B A cup B / A join B / A union B

x-1 x minus one

x±1 x plus or minus one

xy xy / x multiplied by y

(x-y)(x+y) x minus y, x plus y

= the equals sign

x=5 x equals 5 / x is equal to 5
